<strong> This repository contains code to make a simple map of earthquake locations and magnitudes data with Leaflet.js. </strong>

----

The output map shows all earthquake locations over a seven day period.

<ul>
  <li> Size of each symbol represents the relative magnitude of the earthquake.</li>
  <li> Symbol color is based on earthquake depth (in km), broken into quartiles.</li>
</ul>

The data are pulled directly from the last seven day link in:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

Some extra styling for legend was done in css.
