This repository contains code to demonstrate a simple map in Leaflet.js.

At the present time, only use the directory termed: Leaflet-Challenge-1 (Leaflet_Challenge-2 has not yet been attempted)).

The map shows all earthquake locations over a seven day period.

The size of each symbol represents the relative magnitude of the earthquake and symbol color is based earthquake depth (in km), broken into quartiles.

The data are pulled directly from the last seven day link in:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

Some extra styling for legend was done in css.
